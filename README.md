# Destination Date Night 

## Aim

To create an interactive front end website that responds accordingly to the users actions. This website is designed so users can search for their perfect date.

## Purpose

## 5 Planes

### Strategy

### Scope 

### Structure

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

Desktop and Mobile wireframes were created to demonstrate the intial idea for the site. They were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).

#### Mobile

The [Mobile](assets/wireframes/destination-date-night-mobile.png) wireframe shows a view were all of the features sit on top of each other in a responsive manner. For example the navbar utilises the hamburger icon add is positioned on the right, the date type/xx /location dropdowns are central and the footer information sits ontop in a central position.

#### Desktop

The [Desktop](assets/wireframes/destination-date-night-desktop.png) wireframe gives a more spaced look with columns of two for the map and date type/xx/ location dropdowns and three columns for the footer information.

## Testing

#### Issue 1

Footer 
- I struggled to get the positioning right in footer finally managed after testing a few different scenarios. Realised I should have done the testing in a branch to show the workings.
- Font Awesome Instragam icon square would not load, all other social icons in square format worked just this one, I eventually tried the alternative non square icon and this displayed correctly, therefore kept this icon on the site.

#### Issue 2

Navbar
- The Navbar was built following Bootstrap Navbar Documentation, however I wanted the navbar hamburger on the right instead of left on mobiles. After reviewing Bootstrap again I realised I had not added 'navbar-brand' to the nav html so I added this in. I also moved the entire 'a class' to above the 'button', this changed the position of the hamburger on mobiles.

#### Issue 3

Background image
- After adding a container to my background image, the image moved and I ended up with a offset margin to the left .........

#### Issue 4

IPAD
- During the creation of this project getting it to be responsive on an IPAD proved challenging. ..............
