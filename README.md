# Destination Date Night 

## Aim

To create an interactive front end website that responds accordingly to the users actions. This website is designed so users can search for their perfect date.

## Purpose

The owner of Destination Date Night wants to create a search based website that allows users to select criteria that in turn presents locations for them to review in order to make decisions on where to go on their date.

It is hoped that the users will find ideas using the search criteria offered and the results the site returns.

## Testing

#### Issue 1

Footer 
- I struggled to get the positioning right in footer finally managed after testing a few different scenarios. Realised I should have done the testing in a branch to show the workings.
- Font Awesome Instragam icon square would not load, all other social icons in square format worked just this one, I eventually tried the alternative non square icon and this displayed correctly, therefore kept this icon on the site.

#### Issue 2

Navbar
- The Navbar was built following Bootstrap Navbar Documentation, however I wanted the navbar hamburger on the right instead of left on mobiles. After reviewing Bootstrap again I realised I had not added 'navbar-brand' to the nav html so I added this in. I also moved the entire 'a class' to above the 'button', this changed the position of the hamburger on mobiles.

#### Issue 3
